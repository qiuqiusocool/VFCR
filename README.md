# VFCR
An adaptive regularized variational model with curvature smoothing constraints, aimed at robustly fusing multi-source DEMs with varying resolutions, noise levels, and data voids. For the code, please refer to VFCR.py.
In this case, y1 and y2 are the DEMs to be fused, and x_VFCR is the fusion result.
